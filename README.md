# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns.
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends. 
The purpose of this analysis is to uncover trends that can benefit Louise to achieve a sucessful Theater Kickstarter campaign.
![Outcomes bases on launch date](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106503121/177914262-1952dbe3-d367-4517-ab5d-1d3b1032def3.png)

Upon reviewing the charts we can see that Theater campaings are the most successful on Kickstarter which is great news for Luoise as she wants to start a Theater campaign.
Also, upon further inspection we can see that campaigns are the most successful during April and July, with May being the most sucessful month to launch a campaign With a notable mention and 2nd highest peak during February.
In conclusion, Theater is the most successful category and combined with a May launch date the rates of success are very favorable.
A mean goal of $5049 should also be set to ensure an even greater success, as if your goal is too high the campaign might fail.

My recommendation is to Set a goal of $5049 combined with a May Launch date to ensure a higher rate of success.
